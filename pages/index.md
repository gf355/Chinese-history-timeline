This site exists as a resource to outline that there has been scientific evidence for some time to support COVID-19 infection being driven by airborne/aerosol transmission. This is not new science, it is old science. The next pandemic should assume the same rather than waste months with policies that did not halt infections. 

## Three timelines are hosted on this microsite

This is important because the world's default pandemic response should have been to treat COVID-19 as if it was airborne.

### Knowing it was airborne, masks were a part of some successful countries strategies:
