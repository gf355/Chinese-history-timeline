# Supporting Canadian frontline nurses

One of the purposes of creating the aerosol timeline was to use scientific evidence of COVID-19 aerosol transmission to support Canadian frontline nurses, who works diligently since the start of the pandemic, but are poorly protected. For more information, please refer to [this article](https://nursesunions.ca/governments-must-update-their-guidance-for-health-care-workers-to-recognize-and-respond-to-the-science-on-covid-19-transmission/).
