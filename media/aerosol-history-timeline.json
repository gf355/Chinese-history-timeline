Because he saw most transmission happening at short-range, which he called 'close contact', he suggested it was reasonable to him that this meant diseases were transmitted by droplets. He is wrong about this last part but the rest was brilliant. As an aside, he did not think fomites account for much transmission."

Given that airborne-sized and droplet-sized particles contain viral RNA, the use of droplet precautions exclusively may be insufficient to protect healthcare workers from exposure to virus in airborne-sized particles"
